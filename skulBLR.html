                <b><u>Institute Brief:</u></b><br>
                Sophia Opportunity School was envisaged and begun in 1972 by Sister Joelle, SND, and has 
                continued by the dedicated hard work of more Sisters of Notre Dame and their collaborators. 
                The school began in a humble way with just four students in one of the rooms then available. 
                With the growing number of students classes had to be conducted in the basement of an old building. 
                Gradually, as the school built up a reputation in the field of rehabilitation of children with special needs, 
                the increasing numbers of students made it necessary to build a school spacious enough.
